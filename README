Description
-----------
Demo of how to use MPI spawn to start up a sufficient number of processes to run
a specified number of Process-like classes and their constructor arguments.

Remarks
-------
In principle, the process classes to be executed on each node can also be
serialized and transmitted rather than attempting to find the appropriate module
for the spawned backend to import.
