The Neurokernel Project was begun in 2012 by Aurel A. Lazar [1]_ at Columbia
University's Department of Electrical Engineering after extensive discussions
held during a research seminar on Massively Parallel Neural Computation
[2]_. Neurokernel is currently being developed by the following core team at the
Bionet Group [3]_:

* Lev Givon [4]_
* Nikul H. Ukani [5]_
* Chung-Heng Yeh [6]_
* Yiyin Zhou [7]_

Other contributors who have participated in the project include

* Daniel S. Chevitarese
